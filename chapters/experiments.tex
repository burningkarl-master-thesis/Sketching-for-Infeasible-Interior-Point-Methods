Some practical remarks:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \Cref{line:compute-v} of \cref{alg:newton-direction} can be simplified to directly compute \(\mat{S}^{-1}\vek{v}\) which is needed in \cref{line:compute-delta-x}.
  \item We can use a sparse QR solver in \cref{alg:newton-direction} (SPQR by Tim Davis)
  \item How to choose \(\alpha\)?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The function \((\vek{x}^k + \alpha \Delta\vek{x}^k)^T (\vek{s}^k + \Delta\vek{s}^k)\) is a quadratic function in \(\alpha\) so it is easy to minimise.
    \item We do not need to minimise \(\mu(\alpha)\). Just choose \(\alpha = 0.9\).
  \end{itemize}
  \item We do not need to care about \(\vek{v}\) in practice. (Experiment with this: How do \(\norm{\vek{v}}\) and \(\norm{\vek{f}}\) behave?)
  \item To avoid nearly rank-deficient matrices we need to construct our synthetic data in a clever way
  \item Real data can be obtained from netlib or the datasets used by Avron
  \item How to terminate CG? Fixed number of iterations, fixed accuracy?
  \item We do not need to scrap our results if the subspace embedding fails
  \item How to choose \(\sigma\)? \(\sigma = 0.1\) should be good, cite Zhen
  \item How to choose \(w, s\)? \(m < w < 2m\) and \(s = 2, 3\) works, cite Zhen
  \item It does not matter if the implementation is indeed the long-step infeasible IPM above, an existing Mehrotra Predictor-Corrector code is also okay.
\end{enumerate}
