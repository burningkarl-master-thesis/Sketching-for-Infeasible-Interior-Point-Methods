\chapter{Introduction}

This dissertation is based on the work of Chowdhury \etal{} \cite{Avron-FasterRandomizedInfeasibleIPMs} who propose to use sketching techniques to speed up the solution of the Newton system in an infeasible interior-point method (IPM).
In this thesis their algorithm is analysed in detail to obtain global convergence guarantees and polynomial time-complexity estimates. Furthermore, experiments are conducted to compare this approach to standard ones.
